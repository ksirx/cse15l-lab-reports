__CSE 15L Lab Report 5__

In this lab report, I am doing to demonstrate the process of asking help for debugging. This is a process that we all have/had to go through before. Here is a demonstration of how this process should look like.

__Part 1: Debugging Scenario__

A student is having trouble with testing some code and decides to ask this on EdStem...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?__

I am currently using a Windows computer (Dell XPS). I use the editor from VSCode with which I also use the terminal for bash.

__Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.__

Here is the output of the code when I run it:

```[cs15lsp23cv@ieng6−202]:lab7:515 bash test.sh 

JUnit version 4.13.2 .E.E Time: 0.017 There were 2 failures:

FAILURES!!! Tests run: 2, Failures: 2
```

There seems to be issues with the code at the first element of the array. Both tests expected a in the first slot of the array, but instead it was x and c respectively that was found in index 0 of the array during the test.

__Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.__

Here is the code that was being run with the $ bash test.sh command that I used for the test.

public class ListExamplesTests {
        @Test(timeout = 500)
        public void testMerge1() {
                List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("x", "y"));
                List<String> l2 = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("a", "b"));
                assertArrayEquals(new String[]{ "a", "b", "x", "y"}, ListExamples.merge(l1, l2).toArray());
        }
        @Test(timeout = 500)
        public void testMerge2() {
                List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"));
                List<String> l2 = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("c", "d", "e"));
                assertArrayEquals(new String[]{ "a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "e" }, ListExamples.merge(l1, l2).toArray());
        }
}

As you can see "a" is the expected value for both, but we are instead getting "x" for the first one, and "c" for the second one. Here's the code being run for the merge method

static List<String> merge(List<String> list1, List<String> list2) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int index1 = 0, index2 = 0;
    while(index1 < list1.size() && index2 < list2.size()) {
      if(list2.get(index2).compareTo(list1.get(index1)) < 0) {
        result.add(list1.get(index1));
        index1 += 1;
      }
      else {
        result.add(list2.get(index2));
        index2 += 1;
      }
    }
    while(index1 < list1.size()) {
      result.add(list1.get(index1));
      index1 += 1;
    }
    while(index2 < list2.size()) {
      result.add(list2.get(index2));
      // change index1 below to index2 to fix test
      index2 += 1;
    }
    return result;
}

Can you help me find what part of the code is causing the issue? I am really stuck and unsure of the changes that need to be made for the code to run as intended.

A TA sees the post and responds to this post

Hello,

As you can see from your output, there must be an issue with how the two arrays are being compared before they are being merged. Have you checked the use of compareTo in the merge method? Check of this fixes the problem and feel free to post again if this still doesn't fix the issue.

-TA

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After looking at the code, the student spots an error and changes it. When running the code with ```bash test.sh``` again, the student sees this. The code has succesfully been debugged!


[cs15lsp23cv@ieng6-202]:lab7:514$ bash test.sh
JUnit version 4.13.2
..
Time: 0.018

OK (2 tests)

The error the student spotted did have something to do with how the arrays were being compared. The TA was accurate with spotting where the bug was located. In the if statement, the lists were being compared backwards. To change this, the student had to swap the comparison from list2.get(index2) and list1.get(index1)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To summarize the changes that needed to be made to the merge method in order for the tests to work, the code had to go from this initially

static List<String> merge(List<String> list1, List<String> list2) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int index1 = 0, index2 = 0;
    while(index2 < list2.size() && index1 < list1.size()) {
      if(list1.get(index1).compareTo(list2.get(index2)) < 0) {
        result.add(list1.get(index1));
        index1 += 1;
      }
      else {
        result.add(list2.get(index2));
        index2 += 1;
      }
    }
    while(index1 < list1.size()) {
      result.add(list1.get(index1));
      index1 += 1;
    }
    while(index2 < list2.size()) {
      result.add(list2.get(index2));
      // change index1 below to index2 to fix test
      index2 += 1;
    }
    return result;
}

When running the test using 

$ bash test.sh

Both tests fail which shows that there is an issue that needs to be fixed. After the necessary changes are made to fix the code, it now looks like this...

static List<String> merge(List<String> list1, List<String> list2) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int index1 = 0, index2 = 0;
    while(index1 < list1.size() && index2 < list2.size()) {
      if(list1.get(index1).compareTo(list2.get(index2)) < 0) {
        result.add(list1.get(index1));
        index1 += 1;
      }
      else {
        result.add(list2.get(index2));
        index2 += 1;
      }
    }
    while(index1 < list1.size()) {
      result.add(list1.get(index1));
      index1 += 1;
    }
    while(index2 < list2.size()) {
      result.add(list2.get(index2));
      // change index1 below to index2 to fix test
      index2 += 1;
    }
    return result;
}

The changes are compliled and tested by using the commmand.

$ bash test.sh

And we can see that the bug has been fixed marking the end of the debugging process!

__Part 2: Reflection__

I would say the most interesting thing that I have learned during the second half of the quarter was how to use Vim to edit within the command line. The feel when editing in Vim is interesting when compared to what I am used to using in VSCode. I could see how Vim could be more efficient when you really learn the key binds, but there is a considerable skill curve to really become profient in using it. Also, bash commands were cool to learn aswell. There are so many shortcuts to learn and different options you can apply that you learn something new everytime you use it. One use in particular that I used was rm -rf which I used to delete repositories within my account through the command line.
