A new skill that I learned during Wednesday's lab was how to remotely log into an ieng6 account. This skill opens the door many practical applications and will be a skill that is important to carry into the workforce. This comes in handy especially when you need to run commands or sift through files on your account. At UCSD, we use ACCOUNT_NAME@ieng6.edu.

Here are some important steps you should follow in order to log into an ieng6 account.

__1) Make sure you are able to access ieng6 account.__

This step is key because without your account, you wouldn't have anything to access remotely. 

__2) Download VSCode__

__3) Download Git__
